                      for Atlas (BI Connector) is only available for M10 and larger

                      users SQL-based access to their MongoDB databases. As a result,
                      the BI Connector performs operations which may be CPU and memory
                      intensive. Given the limited hardware resources on M10 and M20

                      upgrade to an M30 or larger cluster or disable the BI Connector.

                      users SQL-based access to their MongoDB databases. As a result,
                      the BI Connector performs operations which may be CPU and memory
                      intensive. Given the limited hardware resources on M10 and M20

                      upgrade to an M30 or larger cluster or disable the BI Connector.
